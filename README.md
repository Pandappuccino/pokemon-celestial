# Pokémon: Celestial Version v0.1.0
*Ten years ago, a meteor that became collectively known as the **Cobalt Comet** for its vibrant blue color as it streaked through the atmosphere nearly wiped out the islandic Medaro region. It was only thanks to the sacrifice of its guardian deities, who shattered the meteorite with their bodies to disperse it, that the Medaro region avoided total destruction--however, the shower of meteorites still devastated the region, upheaving the ecosystem and causing widespread destruction. The people of Medaro survived the incident, but in order to restore their once-beautiful region, all Pokémon League activity was suspended indefinitely until restoration was completed.*

*However, thanks to a massive donation from the relief organization known as Ophiuchus on the eve of the ten-year memorial of the disaster, not only has recovery been expedited, but in celebration of the aid received, the Medaro Pokémon League has finally reopened its doors to new challengers, with the goal of every Trainer to claim the ultimate prize: the title of Champion.*

***<u>Pokémon: Celestial Version</u>*** (or just *Pokémon Celestial*) is a Pokémon fangame created using RPG Maker XP and the Pokémon Essentials v21 engine. It attempts to capture the feel of a classic Pokémon game--from the GBA and DS era--with the addition of quality of life features from later games to provide players with a fun and engaging gameplay experience. This is a nonprofit labor of love by a fan who has been playing Pokémon games since they were seven years old, starting with Pokémon Crystal; absolutely no money is being made in the development of this game.
